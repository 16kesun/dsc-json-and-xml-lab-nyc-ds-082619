# JSON Intro Lab

Here you'll get a little more practice working with JSON files before moving on to playing with APIs all on your own where you'll synthesize reading documentation, making get requests and then parsing JSON data.

### Open the same dataset from json


```python
#Your code here
```

### What is the root data type of the json file?


```python
### Your code here
```

### Navigate to the 'data' key of your loaded json object. What data type is this?


```python
#Your code here
```

### Preview the first entry from the value returned by the 'data' key above.


```python
#Your code here
```

### Preview the Entry under meta -> view -> columns (the keys of three successively nested dictionaries)


```python
#Your code here
```

### Create a DataFrame from your json data
The previous two questions previewed one entry from the data object within the json file, as well as the column details associated with that data from the meta entry within the json file. Both should have 19 entries. Create a DataFrame of the data. Be sure to use the information from the meta entry to add appropriate column names to your DataFrame.


```python
#Your code here
```

### What's wrong with the first row of the DataFrame?


```python
# Your code here
```

## Summary

Congratulations! You've started exploring some more complicated data structures used for the web and got to practice data munging and exploring!
